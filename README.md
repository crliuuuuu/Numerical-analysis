# Numerical Analysis

This repository contains my personal implementation of some numerical analysis-related projects using C++. Each projectcomes with its own set of reference tests and a Chinese test report.

## Contents

The repository covers the following projects:

- Spline solver
- Polynomial interpolation solver
- Equation solver


## Usage

For instructions on how to use these projects, please refer to the `README.md` file within each specific project.
